# ip4life-app

This is the macOS companion app for [IP 4 Life](https://ip4.life). When you run it, your public IP address will appear in your Menu Bar. To save energy, it does not automatically update every five minutes or what have you; just click "Refresh" from the dropdown menu. I'm adding a "Copy" button soon.
